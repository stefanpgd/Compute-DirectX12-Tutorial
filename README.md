# Compute With DirectX 12 - Tutorial Framework
This framework is part of the small article series I'm writting about Compute Shaders with DirectX 12.
- Part 1 - The Theory: https://www.stefanpijnacker.nl/article/compute-with-directx12-part-1/
- Part 2 - The Setup: https://www.stefanpijnacker.nl/article/compute-with-directx-12-part-2/
- Part 3 - Particle Simulation: **WIP**

Any corrections/suggestions relating to the code or the article(s) can be made here through a pull-request.
Note that this is quite a minimal framework. It is meant as a quick startup to follow with the tutorial. 
Feel free to build off from it.

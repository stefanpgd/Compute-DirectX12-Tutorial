# Compute With DirectX 12 - Tutorial Framework
This framework is part of the small article series I'm writting about Compute Shaders with DirectX 12.
- Part 1 - The Theory: https://www.stefanpijnacker.nl/article/compute-with-directx12-part-1/
- Part 2 - Backend: **WIP**

Any corrections/suggestions can be made here through pull-request.
Note that this framework isn't perfect, but meant as a quick startup to follow with the tutorial. 
Feel free to improve or build off from it.
